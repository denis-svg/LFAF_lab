This repository contains reports of my laboratory works for the LFAF course.

# Source code

## Labs 1 & 2

I put my grammar and finite automaton implementation into a separate repository called [angryowl](https://github.com/shunlog/angryowl),
so that I can learn how packages are made, with documentation and all.

## Lab 3

Ideally, I want to write a lexer generator that would fit nicely in my [angryowl](https://github.com/shunlog/angryowl) package,
but for now I wrote a lexer by hand inside `./src`.
